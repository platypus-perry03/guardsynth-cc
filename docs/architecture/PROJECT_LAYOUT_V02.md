# Project layout v2

- Status: approved migration target
- Effective date: 2026-08-09
- Scope: entire `guardsynth-cc` workspace

## 1. Design goals

The repository uses one canonical location for each artifact class:

1. requirements, plans, designs, surveys, and human-readable reports live in `docs/`;
2. reusable publishable implementation lives in `src/`;
3. user-facing orchestration lives in domain-grouped `cli/pipelines/`;
4. experiment directories contain protocols, configurations, and experiment-local code, not results;
5. generated intermediate and final run artifacts live in `artifacts/`;
6. package-level regression tests live in `tests/`;
7. data, third-party sources, runtime environments, papers, and archives remain isolated.

## 2. Canonical top-level tree

## 3. Ownership rules

| Content | Canonical owner | Forbidden placement |
|---|---|---|
| research requirement or locked implementation prompt | `docs/requirements/` | `experiments/`, repository root |
| active research plan | `docs/plans/` | `research/`, `artifacts/` |
| operational/software design | `docs/designs/` or `docs/architecture/` | result directories |
| literature survey | `docs/surveys/` | active plan folders |
| stable narrative report | `docs/reports/` | `src/`, experiment source folders |
| reusable Python module | `src/<package>/` | `experiments/` except compatibility wrappers |
| CLI orchestration | `cli/pipelines/<domain>/<purpose>/run.py` | reusable semantics modules |
| package regression test | `tests/<package>/` | `src/` |
| experiment protocol/local analysis | `experiments/<family>/` | `src/` unless reusable |
| regenerable intermediate output | `artifacts/intermediate/` | `experiments/` |
| final run result and manifest | `projects/04-guardsynth-coc/artifacts/public|restricted/` | `experiments/` |

Experiment-local tests may remain beside tightly coupled historical experiment code. Tests for
the maintained `guard_synth_eblc` package are canonical under `tests/guard_synth_eblc/`.
The source-aware generation layer is owned by `projects/04-guardsynth-coc/src/guard_synth/` and its user-facing
workflows by `projects/04-guardsynth-coc/pipelines/cli/`; it must not be folded into the frozen EBLC
operational-semantics package.

## 4. Run directory contract

Every new run uses:

```text
artifacts/results/<class>/<experiment-id>/<run-id>/
├── RESULT.json
├── RUN_MANIFEST.json
├── REPORT_KO.md                  # when a narrative report is required
└── <domain-specific artifacts>
```

`<class>` is `public` or `restricted`. A runner must refuse to overwrite an existing run ID.
Intermediate output may be replaced only when its manifest explicitly marks it regenerable.

## 5. Migration mapping

| Previous path | Canonical v2 path |
|---|---|
| `research/plans/` | `docs/plans/` |
| `research/background/` | `docs/designs/` or `docs/surveys/` |
| `research/*REPORT*.md` | `docs/reports/` |
| root survey/working notes | `docs/surveys/` or `docs/notes/` |
| `experiments/results/baseline/` | `projects/04-guardsynth-coc/artifacts/public/` |
| `experiments/results/restricted/` | `projects/04-guardsynth-coc/artifacts/restricted/` |
| `platforms/eblc-bcv/experiments/eblc_p0b/test_*.py` | `tests/guard_synth_eblc/test_*.py` |
| `platforms/eblc-bcv/pipelines/cli_<purpose>/` | `platforms/eblc-bcv/pipelines/cli/<purpose>/` |

Historical result contents are immutable. Their recorded old paths remain historical facts;
`MIGRATION_MAP.json` maps them to the new physical locations.

Root-level solver distributions move to `runtime/solvers/`; their original zip/tar archives
move to `archive/installers/`.

## 6. Enforcement

`tests/structure/test_project_layout.py` enforces the canonical roots, rejects new result
directories under `experiments/`, verifies EBLC pipeline grouping, and checks that maintained
EBLC tests are not added back to the compatibility experiment package.

Run the complete migration audit with:

```bash
python3 -m cli.pipelines.maintenance.project_layout_audit.run --run-id <new-run-id>
```
