# GuardSynth-CoC

This is the current central research project. It combines CoC and scene context with external
rule/system evidence, target-zone grounding, and assurance inputs to generate constraints. EBLC
is its output platform, not its final research objective.

The first paper focuses on source-grounded extraction → EBLC verification → faithful natural-language
constraints in CoC training → matched-budget learning effects. Broad runtime/Alpamayo integration,
full-cohort expansion and actual-vehicle validation are phase-2 development, not paper-1 gates.
See the [scope decision](docs/decisions/PAPER_AND_DEPLOYMENT_SCOPE_DECISION_V01.md).
Actual multimodal VLM fine-tuning and held-out visual action evaluation are mandatory for the
first paper; a frozen VLM with only an external scorer trained is not a substitute.

Reusable EBLC execution is provided by [`platforms/eblc-bcv/`](../../platforms/eblc-bcv/).
The independent EBLC language and verification paper is managed by
[`projects/05-eblc-language-verification/`](../05-eblc-language-verification/); GuardSynth remains
the application and synthesis project.
